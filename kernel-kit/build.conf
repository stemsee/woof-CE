# name it whatever you like, usually put in a signifier for your distro
# eg: "s" is for slacko
package_name_suffix=slacko_32

# this is the kernel suffix hack, you can leave it empty ie: uname -r
# if you don't leave empty the leading "dash" is required
# example:
#custom_suffix=-4G

# if you have a multicore processor you can set this var
# don't set if you have a single core! >> cooked machine

## FATDOG style Kernel AKA "huge" kernel###
# if this option is set a FatDog style kernel is produced
# modules are split out of the kernel package and squashfs'd
# NOTE: all modules for booting must be builtins as none go into the initrd.gz
# Please make sure you use an appropriate DOTconfig
# 0 is off, 1 is on, default is not set
#FD=0
FD=1

### squashfs compression ###
# leave unset for the default of your mksquashfs binary
# run "mksquashfs --help" to find out options from compression
# for extra compression "-comp xz -Xbcj ia64" or "-comp xz -Xbcj x86" etc
# Consult the mksquashfs manual for more info.
COMP="-comp xz"

# Overide the default firmware URL ONLY FOR HUGE build

# This kit now gets firmware from kernel.org
# The default is to produce a 'cut down' firmware package that is
# included in the kernel package, however you can include the much larger
# firmware construction that doesn't cut down the firmware but tailors it
# to the kernel configuration in DOTconfig. 
# To set the 'big' variable uncomment the folowing line:
#fw_flag=big
